# AI Agents Collection

Learn to build autonomous AI agents that can reason, plan, and take actions in complex environments. From simple reactive agents to sophisticated multi-agent systems.

## What You'll Learn

- **Agent Architecture**: Core components and design patterns
- **Planning & Reasoning**: Decision-making algorithms and strategies
- **Tool Integration**: Connecting agents to external systems and APIs
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordination and communication between agents
- **Production Deployment**: Scaling and monitoring agent systems

## Prerequisites

- Strong Python programming skills
- Understanding of LLMs and prompt engineering
- Basic knowledge of APIs and system integration
- Familiarity with async programming concepts

## Learning Path

This collection progresses from simple agents to complex autonomous systems:

1. **Foundation** (Posts 1-3): Basic agent concepts and simple implementations
2. **Advanced** (Posts 4-6): Complex reasoning and planning systems
3. **Production** (Posts 7-9): Multi-agent systems and deployment

Each post includes complete code examples and practical projects.
