# Getting Started with UV: Modern Python Package Management

So, you've learned Python basics and you're ready to build something amazing! Whether it's web backends, AI applications, or data analysis tools, you'll need **Python libraries** to unlock the language's full potential.

This guide covers everything you need to know about Python libraries and how to manage them efficiently with **UV**, the fastest Python package manager available today.

## What Are Python Libraries?

Python libraries are pre-written code collections created by the open-source community that solve common programming challenges. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can leverage these battle-tested tools to build faster and more reliably.

### Popular Library Categories

*  Web Development: Flask, Django, FastAPI for building APIs and web applications
*  Frontend: Streamlit, Gradio for interactive web interfaces  
*  Game Development: Pygame for 2D games and multimedia applications
*  AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn for machine learning
*  Data Science: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization
*  Utilities: Requests for HTTP calls, Click for CLI tools

Libraries save development time, reduce bugs, and provide proven solutions to complex problems.

## The Importance of Dependency Management

When working with Python libraries, you need robust tools to install and manage them effectively. This is where package managers like `pip`, `uv`, or `poetry` come in (similar to `npm` in JavaScript or `cargo` in Rust).

### Why Package Managers Matter

*  Version Control: Install specific library versions and track dependencies
*  Project Isolation: Keep each project's dependencies separate and conflict-free  
*  Reproducibility: Ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production
*  Team Collaboration: Share exact dependency specifications with teammates

## Hands-On Tutorial: Building Your First UV Project

Let's create a real project to demonstrate UV's capabilities. We'll build a simple data analysis script using NumPy to showcase both UV's package management and NumPy's power for numerical computing.

### Step 1: Install UV

First, install UV using the official
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Alternative methods:**

```bash
# Using pip
pip install uv

# Using Homebrew (macOS)
brew install uv

# Using cargo (if you have Rust)
cargo install uv
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
uv --version
```

### Step 2: Create and Initialize a Project

UV makes project creation incredibly simple:

```bash
# Create a new project directory
uv init data-analysis-demo
cd data-analysis-demo
```

This command creates a complete project structure:

```bash
data-analysis-demo/
├── .python-version     # Python version specification
├── pyproject.toml      # Modern Python project configuration
├── README.md          # Project documentation
└── src/               # Source code directory
    └── data_analysis_demo/
        └── __init__.py
```

Let's examine the generated `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "data-analysis-demo"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
dependencies = []

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

### Step 3: Add Dependencies

UV makes dependency management effortless. Let's add NumPy for numerical computing:

```bash
# Add NumPy to your project
uv add numpy

# Add development dependencies (optional)
uv add --dev pytest black mypy
```

UV automatically:

*  Creates a virtual environment (`.venv/`)
*  Updates `pyproject.toml` with the new dependency
*  Generates `uv.lock` for reproducible installs
*  Installs the package and all its dependencies

Your `pyproject.toml` now includes:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "numpy>=1.24.0",
]

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
    "black>=23.0.0",
    "mypy>=1.0.0",
]
```

### Step 4: Create Your First Script

Let's build a practical data analysis script. Create `data_analysis.py` in your project root:

```python
"""
Data Analysis Demo with NumPy
Demonstrates basic numerical computing and statistical operations
"""
import numpy as np

def analyze_data():
    """Perform basic data analysis operations"""

    # Generate sample data
    print("🔢 Generating sample data...")
    data = np.random.normal(100, 15, 1000)  # 1000 samples, mean=100, std=15

    # Basic statistics
    print(f"\n Dataset Statistics:")
    print(f"   Sample size: {len(data)}")
    print(f"   Mean: {np.mean(data):.2f}")
    print(f"   Median: {np.median(data):.2f}")
    print(f"   Standard deviation: {np.std(data):.2f}")
    print(f"   Min value: {np.min(data):.2f}")
    print(f"   Max value: {np.max(data):.2f}")

    # Array operations
    print(f"\n Array Operations:")
    squared_data = data ** 2
    normalized_data = (data - np.mean(data)) / np.std(data)

    print(f"   Mean of squared values: {np.mean(squared_data):.2f}")
    print(f"   Normalized data range: {np.min(normalized_data):.2f} to {np.max(normalized_data):.2f}")

    # Advanced operations
    print(f"\n Advanced Analysis:")
    percentiles = np.percentile(data, [25, 50, 75])
    print(f"   25th percentile: {percentiles[0]:.2f}")
    print(f"   50th percentile: {percentiles[1]:.2f}")
    print(f"   75th percentile: {percentiles[2]:.2f}")

    # Find outliers (values beyond 2 standard deviations)
    mean, std = np.mean(data), np.std(data)
    outliers = data[(data < mean - 2*std) | (data > mean + 2*std)]
    print(f"   Outliers found: {len(outliers)} ({len(outliers)/len(data)*100:.1f}%)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("🚀 NumPy Data Analysis Demo")
    print("=" * 40)
    analyze_data()
    print("\n Analysis complete!")
```

### Step 5: Run Your Script

UV provides multiple ways to run your code:

```bash
# Method 1: Direct execution (recommended)
uv run python data_analysis.py

# Method 2: Using the uvx runner for installed packages
uv run --with numpy python -c "import numpy; print(f'NumPy version: {numpy.__version__}')"

# Method 3: Manual virtual environment activation
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
python data_analysis.py
```

Expected output:

```
NumPy Data Analysis Demo
========================================
🔢 Generating sample data...

Dataset Statistics:
   Sample size: 1000
   Mean: 99.87
   Median: 99.45
   Standard deviation: 14.92
   Min value: 55.23
   Max value: 142.18

Array Operations:
   Mean of squared values: 10198.45
   Normalized data range: -2.99 to 2.83

Advanced Analysis:
   25th percentile: 89.76
   50th percentile: 99.45
