# Fine-Tuning Collection

Learn to fine-tune and customize Large Language Models for specific tasks, domains, and use cases. From basic parameter-efficient methods to full model training.

## What You'll Learn

- **Fine-Tuning Fundamentals**: When and why to fine-tune models
- **Parameter-Efficient Methods**: LoRA, adapters, and efficient techniques
- **Data Preparation**: Dataset creation and preprocessing strategies
- **Training Strategies**: Hyperparameter tuning and optimization
- **Evaluation & Deployment**: Testing fine-tuned models and production deployment

## Prerequisites

- Strong understanding of machine learning concepts
- Experience with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
- Familiarity with transformer architectures
- Access to GPU resources for training

## Learning Path

This collection progresses from basic fine-tuning to advanced customization:

1. **Foundation** (Posts 1-3): Basic fine-tuning concepts and simple methods
2. **Advanced** (Posts 4-6): Complex training strategies and optimization
3. **Production** (Posts 7-9): Deployment and maintenance of fine-tuned models

Each post includes hands-on tutorials with complete code examples.
