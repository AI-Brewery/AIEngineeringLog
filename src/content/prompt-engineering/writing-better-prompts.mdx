# Writing Better Prompts - Templates, Roles, and Real Examples

You've learned the basics of prompt engineering. Now it's time to level up. The difference between good and great prompts isn't just clarity—it's structure, roles, and templates that transform your interactions with AI from hit-or-miss to consistently brilliant.

Think of this as your toolkit for prompting like a pro. We'll explore how to use structured templates, assign roles that get AI thinking like experts, and build prompts that work reliably every time. Plus, you'll get hands-on examples using Google Gemini that you can immediately apply to your projects.

---

## Why Structure Matters More Than You Think

Here's the thing: most people treat AI prompts like casual conversations. But the best results come from treating them like precise instructions to a highly skilled assistant.

Structured prompts work because they:

- **Reduce ambiguity**: Clear sections mean clearer results
- **Scale easily**: Once you have a template, you can adapt it for different situations
- **Improve consistency**: Same structure, predictable quality
- **Save time**: No more wrestling with vague outputs

> Tip: Start with a simple prompt skeleton and only add complexity if results are inconsistent.

Let's break down the anatomy of a powerful prompt.

---

## The Four-Part Prompt Template That Actually Works

After testing dozens of approaches, this template consistently delivers the best results:

### Template Structure

- **ROLE**: Who the AI should become
- **TASK**: What you want done
- **CONTEXT**: Background information needed
- **FORMAT**: How you want the output structured

> Note: Use these labels explicitly in your prompts. Treat them like headings so the model understands each section’s purpose.

### Real Example: Content Creation

**Basic Version (Weak):**
"Write about sustainable fashion."

**Template Version (Powerful):**

- **ROLE**: You are a sustainability expert with 10 years of experience in fashion industry consulting.
- **TASK**: Write an engaging blog post about sustainable fashion practices that small clothing brands can actually implement.
- **CONTEXT**: The target audience is startup clothing brand owners with limited budgets who want to become more environmentally conscious. They need practical, actionable advice rather than theory.
- **FORMAT**: Structure as:
  - Hook opening paragraph
  - 5 specific practices with implementation costs
  - One real brand example per practice
  - Action steps conclusion
  - 800–1000 words total

See the difference? The template version gives Gemini everything it needs to create exactly what you want.

> Why this works: You give the model a clear persona, goal, constraints, and output format—reducing ambiguity and boosting consistency.

## Role-Based Prompting: Transform AI Into Any Expert

Role prompting is like method acting for AI. When you assign a specific persona, the AI adopts that perspective's knowledge, tone, and approach. This isn't just clever—it's scientifically proven to improve output quality.

### The Expert Framework

Use this formula for expert roles:

> _"You are a [SPECIFIC TITLE] with [YEARS] years of experience in [DOMAIN].
> You specialize in [SPECIALTY] and are known for [UNIQUE APPROACH/STRENGTH]."_

### Role Examples That Work

#### The Technical Mentor

#### Role Setup for Code Review

```python
role = """
You are a senior software engineer with 8 years of experience in Python development.
You specialize in clean code practices and are known for giving constructive,
actionable feedback that helps junior developers improve quickly.
"""

# Combined with task
prompt = f"""
{role}

Review this Python function and provide specific improvements:

python
def calc_total(items):
    total = 0
    for i in items:
        if i['active']:
            total = total + i['price'] * i['quantity']
    return total

Focus on:

Code readability
Performance considerations
Error handling
Python best practices

Format your feedback as numbered suggestions with code examples.
"""
```

#### The Creative Director

You are a creative director at a top advertising agency with 12 years of experience in brand storytelling. You specialize in campaigns that connect emotionally with millennials and Gen Z audiences.

Create 3 social media campaign concepts for a plant-based protein startup targeting fitness enthusiasts aged 25-35. Each concept should include:

- **Core message** (one sentence)
- **Visual style** description
- **Three sample post ideas**
- **Hashtag strategy**

#### The Data Analyst

You are a senior data analyst with expertise in e-commerce analytics. You excel at finding actionable insights in complex datasets and explaining them clearly to non-technical stakeholders.

Analyze this sales data and provide insights:
[Your data here]

Focus on:

- Top 3 trends that impact revenue
- Seasonal patterns worth noting
- Recommendations for the next quarter

Present findings as if briefing the CEO

---

## Template Library: Proven Patterns for Common Tasks

Here are battle-tested templates you can use immediately:

### 1) Problem–Solution Template

You are a [EXPERT_TYPE] helping solve [PROBLEM_DOMAIN] challenges.

Problem: [SPECIFIC_ISSUE]  
Constraints: [LIMITATIONS]  
Goal: [DESIRED_OUTCOME]

Provide:

- Root cause analysis (2-3 key factors)
- Solution options (rank by feasibility)
- Implementation roadmap
- Success metrics

Format as executive summary with bullet points.

### 2) Comparison Analysis Template

Act as an objective analyst comparing [ITEMS_TO_COMPARE].

Evaluation criteria:

- [CRITERION_1]
- [CRITERION_2]
- [CRITERION_3]

For each item, provide:

- Strengths (top 3)
- Weaknesses (top 3)
- Best use case
- Score out of 10

Present as comparison table with final recommendations.

### 3) Step-by-Step Guide Template

You are an experienced [DOMAIN] instructor known for clear, actionable tutorials.

Create a beginner-friendly guide for: [TOPIC]

Structure:

- Prerequisites (what they need first)
- Materials/tools required
- Steps (numbered, with explanations)
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Next steps for continued learning

Target audience: [DESCRIBE_AUDIENCE]  
Tone: Encouraging but practical  
Length: [WORD_COUNT]

## Advanced Techniques That Separate Pros from Beginners

> Pro tip: Start with the simplest approach that works. Add advanced techniques when you need more structure, consistency, or reasoning.

### Chain of Thought Prompting

Get AI to show its work for complex reasoning:

You are a business strategist analyzing market entry opportunities.

Think through this step-by-step:

- First, analyze the market size and growth trends
- Then, identify key competitors and their positioning
- Next, evaluate barriers to entry
- Finally, recommend the best approach

Market: Sustainable packaging for food delivery  
Company: Small startup with $500K funding

Show your reasoning for each step before providing the final recommendation.

### Multi‑Perspective Prompting

Get richer insights by asking for multiple viewpoints:

Analyze this business decision from three perspectives:

Decision: Should we build our own delivery platform or partner with existing services?

Perspectives:

- CFO (focus: costs, ROI, financial risk)
- CTO (focus: technical feasibility, maintenance, scalability)
- Marketing Director (focus: brand control, customer experience, market positioning)

For each perspective, provide:

- Key concerns
- Recommended approach
- Deal-breakers

Then synthesize into a balanced recommendation.

### Constraint‑Based Prompting

Use limitations to drive creativity:

You are a creative problem-solver who thrives within constraints.

Challenge: Design a team-building activity  
Constraints:

- Remote team (video call only)
- 30 minutes maximum
- No budget for tools/software
- Mix of introverts and extroverts
- Team of 8 people

Create 3 activity options that work within ALL constraints.  
For each option, include setup instructions and facilitation tips.

## Setting Up Advanced Prompting with Gemini

Let's build a practical example using our templates with the Google Gemini API. All code is available in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/PraveenMudalgeri/aienglog-codes, in the module2/post2.py file.

### Advanced Prompt Manager Class

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

load_dotenv()

class AdvancedPromptManager:
    def init(self):
        api_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
        self.client = genai.Client(api_key=api_key)

    def expert_prompt(self, role, task, context="", format_instructions="", thinking=False):
        """
        Create structured prompts using the four-part template
        """
        prompt_parts = []

        if role:
            prompt_parts.append(f"[ROLE] {role}")

        if task:
            prompt_parts.append(f"[TASK] {task}")

        if context:
            prompt_parts.append(f"[CONTEXT] {context}")

        if format_instructions:
            prompt_parts.append(f"[FORMAT] {format_instructions}")

        full_prompt = "\n\n".join(prompt_parts)

        config = types.GenerateContentConfig(
            thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(
                thinking_budget=0 if not thinking else None
            )
        )

        response = self.client.models.generate_content(
            model="gemini-2.5-flash",
            contents=full_prompt,
            config=config
        )

        return response.text

    def chain_of_thought(self, problem, steps, context=""):
        """
        Implement chain of thought reasoning
        """
        role = "You are a logical problem-solver who thinks step-by-step."

        task = f"""
        Solve this problem by thinking through each step clearly:

        Problem: {problem}

        Steps to follow:
        {chr(10).join([f"{i+1}. {step}" for i, step in enumerate(steps)])}

        Show your reasoning for each step before providing the final answer.
        """

        return self.expert_prompt(role, task, context)

    def multi_perspective(self, situation, perspectives, decision_criteria):
        """
        Analyze from multiple viewpoints
        """
        role = "You are a strategic advisor skilled at analyzing complex situations from multiple angles."

        task = f"""
        Analyze this situation from different perspectives:

        Situation: {situation}

        Perspectives to consider:
        {chr(10).join([f"- {p}" for p in perspectives])}

        Decision criteria: {decision_criteria}
        """

        format_instructions = """
        For each perspective:
        1. Key concerns
        2. Recommended approach
        3. Potential risks

        Then provide a synthesis with your recommended decision.
        """

        return self.expert_prompt(role, task, "", format_instructions)
```

#### Usage Examples

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pm = AdvancedPromptManager()
```

### Example 1: Content Creation with Expert Role

```python
role = "You are a senior content marketing strategist with 10 years of experience in B2B SaaS marketing."
task = "Create a content calendar for a productivity app targeting remote teams."
context = "The app helps distributed teams coordinate async work. Target audience: remote team leaders at companies with 20-100 employees."
format_instructions = """
Provide:

- 12 content ideas (one per month)
- Content type for each (blog, video, infographic, etc.)
- Key message and target keyword
- Distribution channel recommendations

Format as a table.
"""

result1 = pm.expert_prompt(role, task, context, format_instructions)
print("Content Strategy Result:")
print(result1)
print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

### Example 2: Chain of Thought Problem Solving

```python
problem = "Our mobile app has a 60% user churn rate in the first week. How do we fix this?"
steps = [
    "Identify the main reasons users abandon the app in week 1",
    "Analyze the onboarding flow for friction points",
    "Research what successful apps do differently",
    "Prioritize solutions based on impact vs effort",
    "Create an action plan with metrics"
]
context = "B2C fitness tracking app with 50K monthly downloads, primarily millennial users"

result2 = pm.chain_of_thought(problem, steps, context)
print("Problem Solving Result:")
print(result2)
print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

### Example 3: Multi-perspective Analysis

```python
situation = "Should we expand to the European market this year or focus on growing our US customer base?"
perspectives = [
    "CEO (overall strategy and growth)",
    "CFO (financial implications and risk)",
    "Head of Product (development resources)",
    "Marketing Director (market penetration strategy)"
]
criteria = "ROI potential, resource requirements, risk level, timeline to profitability"

result3 = pm.multi_perspective(situation, perspectives, criteria)
print("Multi-perspective Analysis:")
print(result3)
```

## Real-World Examples That Actually Work

Let's see these templates in action with scenarios you'll face:

### Scenario 1: Product Launch Strategy

Using the expert template for strategic planning

```python
pm = AdvancedPromptManager()
```

```python
role = (
    "You are a product launch strategist who has successfully launched 15+ tech "
    "products, including 3 that achieved $10M+ ARR in their first year."
)

task = (
    "Design a launch strategy for a no-code website builder targeting small "
    "business owners."
)

context = """
Product: Drag-and-drop website builder with AI-powered content suggestions
Target market: Small business owners (restaurants, consultants, local services) who need websites but lack technical skills
Budget: $50,000 for launch campaign
Timeline: 3 months to launch
Competition: Squarespace, Wix, Webflow
"""

format_instructions = """
Provide a comprehensive launch strategy including:

Pre-launch (60 days):
- Audience research approach
- Content strategy for building awareness
- Partnership opportunities

Launch week:
- Channel mix and budget allocation
- Key messages for each audience segment
- Success metrics and tracking

Post-launch (30 days):
- User onboarding optimization
- Feedback collection strategy
- Growth tactics for sustained momentum

Format each section with specific action items and timelines.
"""

launch_strategy = pm.expert_prompt(role, task, context, format_instructions)
print(launch_strategy)
```

### Scenario 2: Technical Architecture Decision

Chain of thought for complex technical decisions

```python
problem = "Our API response times are increasing as we scale. Current average is 800ms, target is under 200ms."

steps = [
"Identify the main bottlenecks in our current API architecture",
"Evaluate caching strategies (Redis, CDN, application-level)",
"Consider database optimization options",
"Assess if microservices architecture would help",
"Calculate cost vs performance impact of each solution",
"Create implementation roadmap with testing strategy"
]

context = """
Current setup:

Django REST API serving 10,000 requests/hour

PostgreSQL database with 2M records

Hosted on AWS with single application server

Main endpoints: user data, product catalog, order processing

80% of requests are read operations
"""

technical_solution = pm.chain_of_thought(problem, steps, context)
print(technical_solution)
```

### Scenario 3: Marketing Campaign Analysis

Multi-perspective analysis for campaign optimization

```python
situation = "Our last email campaign had a 2.1% click-through rate, below our 3.5% target. Should we A/B test subject lines, redesign the email template, or segment our audience differently?"

perspectives = [
"Email Marketing Specialist (focus on technical metrics and optimization)",
"Customer Success Manager (focus on audience needs and preferences)",
"Data Analyst (focus on behavioral patterns and statistical significance)",
"Brand Manager (focus on message consistency and brand perception)"
]

criteria = "Likelihood of improvement, implementation complexity, time to see results, potential impact on brand"

campaign_analysis = pm.multi_perspective(situation, perspectives, criteria)
print(campaign_analysis)
```

## Common Mistakes That Kill Your Prompts

Even with great templates, these mistakes will sabotage your results:

### 1. Role Confusion

- **Wrong:** "Act as a marketing expert and also a developer and also a designer..."
- **Right:** Pick one expert role per prompt. Chain multiple prompts if you need different expertise.

### 2. Context Overload

- **Wrong:** Including every possible detail in one massive context section.
- **Right:** Include only the context that directly impacts the task at hand.

### 3. Vague Format Instructions

- **Wrong:** "Make it look nice."
- **Right:** "Format as a bulleted list with each point containing a bold action item followed by 1-2 sentence explanation."

### 4. Forgetting Constraints

- **Wrong:** Asking for solutions without mentioning budget, time, or resource limitations.
- **Right:** Always include realistic constraints that mirror real-world conditions.

## Testing and Iterating Your Prompts

Here's how to systematically improve your prompts:

### The RICE Method for Prompt Optimization

- **R**un the prompt 3 times with identical inputs
- **I**dentify patterns in the outputs (what's consistent vs. random)
- **C**hange one element at a time (role, context, or format)
- **E**valuate improvement using specific criteria

### Prompt Testing Framework

```python
def test_prompt_variations(pm, base_prompt, variations, test_input):
    """
    Test different prompt variations to find the best performer
    """
    results = {}

    for name, variation in variations.items():
        print(f"Testing: {name}")

        # Run prompt 3 times to check consistency
        outputs = []
        for i in range(3):
            result = pm.expert_prompt(**variation, **test_input)
            outputs.append(result)

        results[name] = {
            'outputs': outputs,
            'consistency': len(set(outputs)),  # Lower number = more consistent
            'avg_length': sum(len(out) for out in outputs) / 3
        }

    return results
```

Example usage

```python
variations = {
    'basic_role': {
        'role': 'You are a marketing expert.',
        'task': 'Create a social media strategy.',
        'format_instructions': 'Provide 5 tactics.'
    },
    'detailed_role': {
        'role': 'You are a social media marketing manager with 7 years of experience growing B2B SaaS companies from 0 to $1M ARR.',
        'task': 'Create a social media strategy for lead generation.',
        'format_instructions': 'Provide 5 tactics with specific examples, expected results, and implementation timelines.'
    }
}

test_input = {
    'context': 'B2B project management software targeting remote teams'
}

# Run tests and compare results
test_results = test_prompt_variations(pm, variations, test_input)
```

## Advanced Use Cases: When Templates Become Powerful

### Dynamic Content Generation

```python
class ContentGenerator:
    def __init__(self, pm):
        self.pm = pm

    def generate_series(self, topic, audience, content_types, count=5):
        """
        Generate a series of related content pieces
        """
        role = f"You are an expert content creator specializing in {topic} for {audience}."

        results = {}
        for content_type in content_types:
            task = f"Create {count} {content_type} ideas about {topic}"
            context = f"Target audience: {audience}"
            format_instructions = f"""
            For each {content_type}, provide:
            - Compelling title
            - Key points to cover (3-4 bullets)
            - Hook for opening
            - Call-to-action
            """

            results[content_type] = self.pm.expert_prompt(
                role, task, context, format_instructions
            )

        return results

# Example: Create content series for a productivity blog
cg = ContentGenerator(pm)
content_series = cg.generate_series(
    topic="time management for entrepreneurs",
    audience="startup founders and small business owners",
    content_types=["blog posts", "YouTube videos", "social media posts"]
)
```

### Interactive Prompt Chaining

```python
def interactive_business_analysis(pm, business_description):
    """
    Chain prompts to build comprehensive business analysis
    """

    # Step 1: Market Analysis
    market_role = "You are a market research analyst with expertise in competitive intelligence."
    market_task = f"Analyze the market opportunity for: {business_description}"
    market_format = "Provide market size, key competitors, and growth trends."

    market_analysis = pm.expert_prompt(market_role, market_task, "", market_format)

    # Step 2: Use market analysis for business model recommendations
    strategy_role = "You are a business strategist who helps companies find product-market fit."
    strategy_task = "Based on this market analysis, recommend the best business model and go-to-market strategy"
    strategy_context = f"Business: {business_description}\n\nMarket Analysis: {market_analysis}"
    strategy_format = "Provide business model options, revenue streams, and 90-day action plan."

    strategy_recommendation = pm.expert_prompt(
        strategy_role, strategy_task, strategy_context, strategy_format
    )

    return {
        'market_analysis': market_analysis,
        'strategy_recommendation': strategy_recommendation
    }

# Example usage
business = "AI-powered meal planning app for busy families"
analysis = interactive_business_analysis(pm, business)
```

## Troubleshooting Your Advanced Prompts

### When Templates Don't Work

**Symptom:** Getting generic outputs despite detailed roles  
**Solution:** Make roles more specific with concrete experience details

**Symptom:** AI ignoring format instructions  
**Solution:** Put format requirements in the task section, not just at the end

**Symptom:** Inconsistent quality across multiple runs  
**Solution:** Add constraints and examples to reduce randomness

### Debugging Prompt Performance

```python
def debug_prompt(pm, role, task, context="", format_instructions=""):
    """
    Test prompt components individually to identify issues
    """

    # Test minimal version first
    minimal = pm.expert_prompt("", task)

    # Test with role only
    with_role = pm.expert_prompt(role, task)

    # Test with role and context
    with_context = pm.expert_prompt(role, task, context)

    # Test full prompt
    full_prompt = pm.expert_prompt(role, task, context, format_instructions)

    return {
        'minimal': minimal,
        'with_role': with_role,
        'with_context': with_context,
        'full_prompt': full_prompt
    }
```

## Next Steps: Building Your Prompt Engineering System

You now have the tools to create prompts that work consistently. Here's how to keep improving:

#### 1. Build Your Template Library

- Start collecting templates that work for your specific use cases. Document what works and what doesn't.

#### 2. Create Role Personas

- Develop a library of expert roles for your domain. The more specific the expertise, the better the results.

#### 3. Establish Testing Processes

- Don't rely on single outputs. Test prompts multiple times and with edge cases.

#### 4. Measure What Matters

- Track metrics like output consistency, time to good result, and how often you need to iterate.

The next post in this series will dive into Thinking Like the Model - Few-Shot, Zero-Shot & Chain of Thought. In this you'll learn in-depth about how to think like a model, when to use these techniques, what is chain of thought and how it works, along with real world examples.
