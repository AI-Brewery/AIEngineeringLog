# RAG Systems Collection

So you want to build a chatbot that doesn't just hallucinate random stuff? Welcome to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - basically the art of making AI models answer questions using your actual documents instead of making things up.

We've been working on these systems for our projects and internships, and honestly, they're pretty cool once you get the hang of it. Think of it as giving your AI a really good search engine for your specific documents.

## What You'll Actually Learn

- **The Basics**: What RAG is and why it's not as scary as it sounds
- **Vector Databases**: How to make computers understand what your documents mean (spoiler: it involves a lot of math you don't need to understand)
- **Document Processing**: Chopping up your PDFs and text files so the AI can digest them
- **Building the System**: Putting it all together into something that actually works
- **Making It Not Crash**: Tips for when you want to show it to people without it breaking

## Before You Start

You should probably know:
- Basic Python (like, you can write a for loop without googling it)
- How to use APIs (we'll be talking to OpenAI and friends)
- What machine learning is (you don't need to be an expert, just not completely lost)

## How We've Organized This

We've broken this down into three phases because that's how we learned it:

1. **Getting Started** (Posts 1-3): Understanding what RAG is and building your first simple version
2. **Making It Better** (Posts 4-6): Real-world strategies and handling edge cases we ran into
3. **Making It Production-Ready** (Posts 7-9): Scaling it up and making it reliable enough for other people to use

Each post builds on the previous ones, so we'd recommend going through them in order. But hey, if you want to jump around, that's cool too - we've tried to make each post somewhat standalone.

## A Quick Reality Check

Fair warning: This stuff can get complex pretty quickly. We've tried to break it down as much as possible, but there will be moments where you'll need to pause and maybe read some documentation or watch a YouTube video to fill in gaps. That's totally normal - we did the same thing.

Also, some of these techniques require API credits (OpenAI, Pinecone, etc.), so you might need to spend a few dollars to follow along with the examples. We've tried to keep costs minimal and suggest free alternatives where possible.
