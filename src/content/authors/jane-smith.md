# About Jane Smith

Jane is a Senior AI Engineer at TechCorp, where she leads the development of production RAG systems serving millions of users. With over 8 years of experience in machine learning and AI, she's passionate about making advanced AI techniques accessible to developers.

## Background

Before TechCorp, Jane worked on the GPT infrastructure team at OpenAI and spent three years at Google Research focusing on information retrieval systems. She holds a Master's in Computer Science from Stanford University.

## Expertise

- **RAG Systems**: Built and scaled RAG applications from prototype to production
- **Vector Databases**: Deep experience with Pinecone, Weaviate, and custom solutions  
- **LLM Applications**: Fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and model optimization
- **Production ML**: MLOps, monitoring, and system architecture

## Recent Projects

- **CustomerBot**: RAG-powered support system reducing response time by 70%
- **DocSearch**: Internal knowledge base serving 10,000+ employees
- **RAG-Eval**: Open-source framework for evaluating RAG system performance

## Writing Philosophy

"I believe the best way to learn AI engineering is by building real systems, not just following tutorials. Every post I write comes from actual production experience - the good, the bad, and the lessons learned along the way."

## Connect

Feel free to reach out if you have questions about RAG systems or want to discuss AI engineering challenges. I'm always happy to help fellow builders!
