# What is RAG? Understanding the Basics

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the most practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) today. Instead of relying solely on the model's training data, RAG systems can access and reason over external knowledge sources in real-time.

## Why RAG Matters

Traditional LLMs have a fundamental limitation: they can only work with information they were trained on. This creates several problems:

- **Knowledge Cutoff**: Models can't access information after their training date
- **Domain Specificity**: They lack deep knowledge about your specific business or documents
- **Hallucination**: Models might generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information

RAG solves these problems by combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with real-time information retrieval.

## How RAG Works

The RAG process involves three main steps:

### 1. Retrieval
When a user asks a question, the system searches through a knowledge base to find relevant documents or passages.

```python
# Simplified example
query = "How do I reset my password?"
relevant_docs = vector_search(query, knowledge_base)
```

### 2. Augmentation
The retrieved information is combined with the original query to create an enhanced prompt.

```python
enhanced_prompt = f"""
Context: {relevant_docs}
Question: {query}
Answer based on the context provided:
"""
```

### 3. Generation
The LLM generates a response using both the original question and the retrieved context.

## What You'll Build

In this series, we'll build a complete RAG system that can:

- Index and search through documents
- Answer questions with source citations
- Handle multiple document types
- Scale to production workloads

## Real-World Example

Let's say you're building a customer support chatbot for a software company. Instead of training a model on all your documentation (expensive and time-consuming), you can:

1. Store your docs in a searchable format
2. When users ask questions, retrieve relevant sections
3. Let the LLM answer using that specific information

This approach is faster, cheaper, and more accurate than traditional methods.

## Next Steps

In the next post, we'll dive into vector databases - the foundation that makes fast, semantic search possible in RAG systems.
