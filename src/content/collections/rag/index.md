# RAG Systems Collection

Learn to build powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that can answer questions using your own documents and data. This collection takes you from understanding the basics to building production-ready systems.

## What You'll Learn

- **Core Concepts**: Understanding RAG architecture and components
- **Vector Databases**: Working with embeddings and similarity search
- **Document Processing**: Chunking strategies and preprocessing
- **System Building**: Creating end-to-end RAG applications
- **Production**: Scaling, monitoring, and optimization

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with APIs (REST/HTTP)
- Understanding of basic machine learning concepts

## Learning Path

This collection follows a structured progression from fundamentals to advanced implementations:

1. **Foundation** (Posts 1-3): Core concepts and first implementation
2. **Building** (Posts 4-6): Real-world applications and strategies  
3. **Production** (Posts 7-9): Scaling, optimization, and monitoring

Each post builds on the previous ones, so we recommend following the sequence for the best learning experience.
