# LLMOps Collection

Master the operational aspects of Large Language Models in production. Learn to deploy, monitor, and maintain LLM systems at scale with reliability and efficiency.

## What You'll Learn

- **Deployment Strategies**: Cloud platforms, containerization, and scaling
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Performance metrics and system health
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource management and efficient inference
- **Security & Compliance**: Safe deployment and data protection
- **CI/CD for LLMs**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines

## Prerequisites

- Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Understanding of containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Basic DevOps and monitoring concepts
- Familiarity with LLM APIs and inference

## Learning Path

This collection covers the full lifecycle of LLM operations:

1. **Foundation** (Posts 1-3): Deployment basics and infrastructure
2. **Monitoring** (Posts 4-6): Observability and performance optimization
3. **Advanced** (Posts 7-9): Security, compliance, and advanced operations

Each post includes real-world scenarios and production-ready examples.
