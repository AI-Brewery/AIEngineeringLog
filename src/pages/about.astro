          <h2>üéì How This Started</h2>
          <p>Okay, so here's the deal. We're a bunch of college students who got really into AI stuff (probably spent way too much time on it instead of studying for other classes, oops üòÖ).</p>
          
          <p>We started this because we were tired of finding tutorials that either:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Were way too basic and didn't actually work in real projects</li>
            <li>Were written by people who clearly hadn't tried building the thing themselves</li>
            <li>Used corporate examples we couldn't relate to</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>So we thought, "Why not document what we're actually building and share it with other students?"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2>üìö What You'll Find Here</h2>
          <p>These are basically our study notes and project documentation, but cleaned up and organized so they might actually be useful to you too.</p>
          
          <p>We cover stuff like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>RAG Systems</strong> - Building chatbots that can actually answer questions about your documents</li>
            <li><strong>AI Agents</strong> - Making AI that can do things automatically (pretty cool tbh)</li>
            <li><strong>Prompt Engineering</strong> - Getting LLMs to do what you actually want them to do</li>
            <li><strong>Fine-Tuning</strong> - Training models on your own data (when you have the compute budget üí∏)</li>
            <li><strong>Production Stuff</strong> - Making your projects work reliably (harder than it sounds)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2>üë• Who We Are</h2>
          <p>We're computer science and engineering students from various colleges who've been working on AI projects in our free time. Some of us are in AI clubs, some are doing research with professors, and some are just building cool stuff because we can.</p>
          
          <p>We're not industry experts or anything - we're just students who've spent way too many nights debugging AI models and figured we'd share what we learned along the way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2>ü§ù Want to Contribute?</h2>
          <p>If you're a student who's built something cool with AI, we'd love to have you share your experience! It doesn't have to be perfect or revolutionary - just real.</p>

          <h2>üí≠ Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p>We believe in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Learning by doing</strong> - Theory is cool, but building stuff is cooler</li>
            <li><strong>Sharing failures</strong> - We document what didn't work too</li>
            <li><strong>Keeping it real</strong> - No pretending we know everything</li>
            <li><strong>Helping each other</strong> - We're all figuring this out together</li>
          </ul>
