- Progress indicators show learning phase (🚀📚🛠️)

**Implemented RAG Collection:**
```
RAG Systems Collection ✅
├── Collection Overview (from index.md)
├── Learning Path:
│   ├── 01. "What is RAG? Understanding the Basics" ✅

## MDX Content Structure ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### Implemented Frontmatter Template

```yaml
---
title: "Building Your First RAG System"
description: "Step-by-step guide to building a document Q&A system from scratch"
collection: "rag"
order: 4                    # Sequential order within collection
author: "jane-smith"
publishDate: 2024-01-15
lastUpdated: 2024-02-01     # Optional
readTime: "12 min"
tags: ["rag", "embeddings", "pinecone", "openai"]
prerequisites: ["01-what-is-rag"]  # ✅ Uses post IDs for linking
# ❌ REMOVED: github and demo fields (content includes these inline)
authorProfile:              # ✅ Embedded author social links
  github: "https://github.com/jane-smith"
  linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/jane-smith"
  twitter: "https://twitter.com/jane_builds_ai"
  website: "https://janesmith.dev"
---
```

**Changes Made During Implementation:**
- ❌ **Removed `github` and `demo` fields**: Authors include these links naturally in content
- ✅ **Prerequisites use post IDs**: Links like `01-what-is-rag` instead of slugs
- ✅ **Astro Content Collections**: Full TypeScript validation via `config.ts`
- ✅ **Embedded author profiles**: Social links included in each post

### Frontmatter Field Descriptions

  email: 'Mail',
  youtube: 'Youtube',
  medium: 'FileText',
  discord: 'MessageCircle'
}
```

### Author Card Display
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 👤 Jane Smith                       │
│ AI Engineer @ TechCorp              │
│ 🐙 📧 🔗 🐦 🌐                     │
